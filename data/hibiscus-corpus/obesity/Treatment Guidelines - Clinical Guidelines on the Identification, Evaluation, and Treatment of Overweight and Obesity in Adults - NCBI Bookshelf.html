Ideal body weight tables were developed primarily from white, higher socioeconomic status populations and have not been documented to accurately reflect body fat content in the public at large.

<ul><li id="A235" class="half_rhythm"><div><i>According to <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d10/">BMI</a>.</i> The primary classification of obesity is based on the measurement of BMI. This classification is designed to relate BMI to risk of disease. It should be noted that the relation between BMI and disease risk varies among individuals and among different populations. Therefore, the classification must be viewed as a broad generalization. Individuals who are very muscular may have a BMI placing them in an overweight category when they are not overly fat. Also, very short persons (under 5 feet) may have high BMIs that may not reflect overweight or fatness. In addition, susceptibility to risk factors at a given weight varies among individuals. Some individuals may have multiple risk factors with mild obesity, whereas others may have fewer risk factors with more severe obesity. It should also be noted that the risk levels shown for each increment in risk are relative risks; that is, relative to risk at normal weight. They should not be equated with absolute risk which is determined by a summation of risk factors. No randomized controlled trial studies exist that support a specific system for classification that establishes the degree of disease risk for patients during weight loss or weight maintenance. The classification is based on observational and prospective epidemiological studies.</div></li></ul>

Physical inactivity enhances the severity of other risk factors, but it also has been shown to be an &#x0201c;independent&#x0201d; risk factor for all-cause mortality or CVD mortality [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1494" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1494/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">411</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1631" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1631/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">548</a>]. Although physical inactivity is not listed as a risk factor that modifies the intensity of therapy required for elevated cholesterol or blood pressure, increased physical activity is indicated for management of these conditions (see the ATP II and JNC VI). Increased physical activity is especially needed in obese patients because it promotes weight reduction and favorably modifies obesity-associated risk factors. Conversely, the presence of physical inactivity in an obese person warrants intensified efforts to remove excess body weight, because physical inactivity and obesity both heighten disease risks.</p></div><div id="A275"><h4>5.b. High triglycerides&#x02014;</h4><p><a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d84/">Obesity</a> is commonly accompanied by elevated serum triglycerides.

In addition, elevated serum triglycerides are the most common manifestation of the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (high triglycerides, small <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d71/">LDL</a> particles, and low <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d57/">HDL</a>-cholesterol levels) [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1225" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1225/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">142</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1632" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1632/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">549</a>]. Moreover, in the presence of obesity, high serum triglycerides are commonly associated with a clustering of metabolic risk factors known as the metabolic syndrome (atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype, hypertension, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and prothrombotic states). Thus, in obese patients, elevated serum triglycerides are a marker for increased cardiovascular risk. According to current guidelines (ATP II and JNC VI), the presence of high triglycerides does not modify the intensity of cholesterol or blood pressure-lowering therapy. Their presence in obese patients, however, calls for an intensified effort to achieve weight reduction and increase physical activity. Both will reduce the various risk factors characteristic of the metabolic syndrome, and thus should reduce overall cardiovascular risk as well as decrease the risk for type 2 diabetes.</p><p>According to the ATP II guidelines [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1225" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1225/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">142</a>], triglyceride levels are classified as follows:</p><p>Patients with very high triglycerides are at increased risk for acute pancreatitis and must undergo immediate triglyceride-lowering therapy.</p></div></div></div><div id="A276"><h2 id="_A276_">D. Evaluation and Treatment Strategy</h2><p>When physicians encounter patients in the clinical setting, the opportunity exists for identifying overweight and obesity and accompanying risk factors and for initiating treatment for both the weight and the risk factors, as well as chronic diseases such as <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d14/">CVD</a> and type 2 diabetes. When assessing a patient for treatment of overweight and obesity, consider the patient's weight, waist circumference, and the presence of risk factors. The strategy for the evaluation and treatment of overweight patients is presented in <a class="figpopup" href="/books/NBK2004/figure/A277/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA277" rid-ob="figobA277">Figure 6</a> (Treatment Algorithm).

It does not reflect any initial overall testing for other conditions and diseases that the physician may wish to do. Approaches to therapy for cholesterol disorders and hypertension are described in ATP II and JNC VI, respectively. In overweight patients, control of cardiovascular risk factors deserves equal emphasis as weight loss therapy. Reductions of risk factors will reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease whether or not efforts at weight loss are successful. The panel recognizes that the assessment for overweight and obesity may take place as part of an overall health assessment; however, for clarity, the algorithm focuses only on the evaluation and treatment of overweight and obesity.

Of greatest urgency is the need to detect existing CVD or end-organ damage. Since the major risk of obesity is indirect (obesity elicits or aggravates hypertension, dyslipidemias, and diabetes, which cause cardiovascular complications), the management of obesity should be implemented in the context of these other risk factors. While there is no direct evidence demonstrating that addressing risk factors increases weight loss, treating the risk factors through weight loss is a recommended strategy. The risk factors that should be considered are provided on pages 63&#x02013;65.

However, it is important to ask the patient whether or not they want to lose weight. Those with BMIs between 25 and 29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who have one or no risk factors should work on maintaining their current weight rather than embark on a weight reduction program. The panel recognizes that the decision to lose weight must be made in the context of other risk factors (e.g., quitting smoking is more important than losing weight) and patient preferences.</p></div><div id="A287"><h3>Box 8: &#x0201c;Clinician and Patient Devise Goals&#x0201d;</h3><p>The decision to lose weight must be made jointly between the clinician and patient. Patient involvement and investment is crucial to success. The patient may choose not to lose weight but rather to prevent further weight gain as a goal. The panel recommends as an initial goal the loss of 10 percent of baseline weight, to be lost at a rate of 1 to 2 lb/week, establishing an energy deficit of 500 to 1,000 kcal/day. (See pages 71&#x02013;72.) For individuals who are overweight, a deficit or 300 to 500 kcal/day may be more appropriate, providing a weight loss of about 1/2 lb/week. Also, there is evidence that an average of 8 percent of weight can be lost in a 6-month period. Since the observed average 8 percent weight loss includes people who do not lose weight, an individual goal of 10 percent is reasonable. After 6 months, most patients will equilibrate (caloric intake balancing energy expenditure) and will require adjustment of energy balance if they are to lose more weight. (See pages 72&#x02013;73.)</p><p>The three major components of weight loss therapy are dietary therapy, increased physical activity, and behavior therapy. (See pages 73&#x02013;82.) Lifestyle therapy should be tried for at least six months before considering pharmacotherapy. In addition, pharmacotherapy should be considered as an adjunct to lifestyle therapy in patients with a <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d10/">BMI</a> &#x02265; 30 with no concomitant obesity-related risk factors or diseases, or for patients with a BMI &#x02265; 27 with concomitant obesity-related risk factors or diseases. The risk factors or diseases considered important enough to warrant pharmacotherapy at a BMI of 27 to 29.9 are hypertension, dyslipidemia, <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d26/">CHD</a>, type 2 diabetes, and sleep apnea. However, sibutramine, the only FDA approved drug for long-term use, should not be used in patients with a history of hypertension, CHD, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, or history of stroke. Certain patients may be candidates for weight loss surgery. Each component of weight loss therapy can be introduced briefly. The selection of weight loss methods should be made in the context of patient preferences, analysis of past failed attempts, and consideration of the available resources.</p></div><div id="A288"><h3>Box 9: &#x0201c;Progress Being Made/Goal Achieved&#x0201d;</h3><p>During the acute weight loss period and at 6-month and 1-year follow-up visits, the patients should be weighed, <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d10/">BMI</a> calculated, and progress assessed. If at any time it appears that the program is failing, a reassessment should take place to determine the reasons (see Box 10). If pharmacotherapy is being used, appropriate monitoring for side effects is recommended (See page 86). If a patient can achieve the recommended 10 percent reduction in body weight in 6 months to 1 year, this change in weight can be considered good progress. The patient can then enter the phase of weight maintenance and long-term monitoring. It is important for the practitioner to recognize that some persons are more apt to lose or gain weight on a given regimen and that this phenomenon cannot always be attributed to degree of compliance. However, if significant obesity remains and absolute risk from obesity-associated risk factors remains high, at some point an effort should be made to reinstitute weight loss therapy to achieve further weight reduction. Once a limit of weight loss has been obtained, the practitioner is responsible for long-term monitoring of risk factors and for encouraging the patient to maintain a reduced weight level.</p></div><div id="A289"><h3>Box 10: &#x0201c;Assess Reasons for Failure to Lose Weight&#x0201d;</h3><p>If a patient fails to achieve the recommended 10 percent reduction in body weight in 6 months or 1 year, a reevaluation is required. A critical question is whether the level of motivation is high enough to continue clinical therapy. If motivation is high, revise the goals and strategies (see Box 8). If motivation is not high, clinical therapy should be discontinued, but the patient should be encouraged to embark on efforts to lose weight or to at least avoid further weight gain. Even if weight loss therapy is stopped, risk factor management must be continued.</p><p>Failure to achieve weight loss should prompt the practitioner to investigate energy intake (dietary recall including alcohol intake, daily intake logs), energy expenditure (physical activity diary), attendance at behavior therapy group meetings, recent negative life events, family and societal pressures, or evidence of detrimental psychiatric problems (depression, binge eating disorder). If attempts to lose weight have failed, and the <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d10/">BMI</a> is &#x02265; 40, surgical therapy should be considered.</p></div><div id="A290"><h3>Box 11: &#x0201c;Maintenance Counseling&#x0201d;</h3><p>Evidence suggests that over 80 percent of persons who lose weight will gradually regain it (see page 72). Patients who continue on weight maintenance programs have a greater chance of keeping weight off. Maintenance consists of continued contact with the health care practitioner for continued education, support, and medical monitoring (see page 72 and 75).</p></div><div id="A291"><h3>Box 12: &#x0201c;Does the Patient Want to Lose Weight?&#x0201d;</h3><p>All patients who are overweight (<a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d10/">BMI</a> 25 to 29.9), or do not have a high waist circumference, and have few (0 to 1) cardiovascular risk factors and do not want to lose weight, should be counseled regarding the need to keep their weight at or below its present level. Patients who wish to lose weight should be guided per Boxes 8 and 9. The justification for offering these overweight patients the option of maintaining (rather than losing) weight is that their health risk, while higher than that of persons with a BMI &#x0003c; 25, is only moderately increased (page 62).</p></div><div id="A292"><h3>Box 13: &#x0201c;Advise to Maintain Weight/Address Other Risk Factors&#x0201d;</h3><p>Those who have a history of overweight and are now at appropriate weight, and those who are overweight and not obese but wish to focus on maintenance of their current weight, should be provided with counseling and advice so that their weight does not increase. An increase in weight increases their health risk and should be prevented. The physician should actively promote prevention strategies including enhanced attention by the patient to diet, physical activity, and behavior therapy. For addressing other risk factors, see Box 6, because even if weight loss cannot be addressed, other risk factors should be covered.</p></div><div id="A293"><h3>Box 14: &#x0201c;History of BMI &#x02265; 25&#x0201d;</h3><p>This box differentiates those who are not overweight now and never have been from those with a history of overweight; see Box 2.</p></div><div id="A294"><h3>Box 15: &#x0201c;Brief Reinforcement&#x0201d;</h3><p>Those who are not overweight and never have been should be advised of the importance of staying in this category.</p></div><div id="A295"><h3>Box 16: &#x0201c;Periodic Weight, BMI, and Waist Circumference Check&#x0201d;</h3><p>Patients should receive periodic monitoring of their weight, <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d10/">BMI</a>, and waist circumference. Patients who are not overweight or have no history of overweight should be screened for weight gain every 2 years. This time span is a reasonable compromise between the need to identify weight gain at an early stage and the need to limit the time, effort, and the cost of repeated measurements.</p></div></div><div id="A296"><h2 id="_A296_">E.

Patient Motivation</h2><p>Assessment of patient motivation is a prerequisite for weight loss therapy. Weight reduction in the clinical setting represents a major investment of time and effort on the part of the health care team and expense to the patient. For these reasons, motivation for weight loss should be relatively high before initiating clinical therapy. At the same time, it is the duty of the primary care practitioner to heighten a patient's motivation for weight loss when such is perceived to be of significant benefit for risk reduction. This can be done by enumerating the dangers associated with persistent obesity and by describing the strategy for clinically assisted weight reduction. For patients who are not motivated (or able) to enter clinical weight loss therapy, appropriate management of risk factors (e.g., high serum cholesterol, hypertension, smoking, and type 2 diabetes) is still necessary. Sustained weight reduction may facilitate control of cardiovascular risk factors and delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.</p><div id="A297.sec0" class="box"><h3><span class="title">Evidence Statement</span></h3><p><i>Patient motivation is a key component for success in a weight loss program.

Reviewing patients' past attempts at weight loss and explaining how the new treatment plan will be different can encourage patients and provide hope for successful weight loss. It is helpful to discuss the proposed course of treatment and describe necessary behaviors, such as keeping diaries of food intake and physical activity.</p><p>Finally, given the social stigmatization that obese patients often feel, even from health care professionals, the initial evaluation is an opportunity to show the patient respect, concern, and hope [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1633" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1633/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">550</a>]. A patient who has shared feelings about being overweight and previous attempts to lose weight with a sympathetic listener may be more willing to consider new ideas and information.

Evidence Category A.</i></p></div><p><b>Rationale:</b> The rationale for this initial goal is that even moderate weight loss, i.e., 10 percent of initial body weight, can significantly decrease the severity of obesity-associated risk factors. It can also set the stage for further weight loss, if indicated. Available evidence indicates that an average weight loss of 8 percent can be achieved in 6 months; however, since the observed average 8 percent includes people who do not lose weight, an individual goal of 10 percent is reasonable. This degree of weight loss can be achieved and is realistic, and moderate weight loss can be maintained over time. It is better to maintain a moderate weight loss over a prolonged period than to regain from a marked weight loss. The latter is counterproductive in terms of time, costs, and self-esteem. Patients generally will wish to lose more weight than 10 percent, and will need to be counseled and persuaded of the appropriateness of this initial goal [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1636" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1636/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">553</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1637" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1637/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">554</a>].

Rate of weight loss&#x02014;</h4><p>A reasonable time line for weight loss is to achieve a 10 percent reduction in body weight over 6 months of therapy. For overweight patients with BMIs in the typical range of 27 to 35, a decrease of 300 to 500 kcal/day will result in weight losses of about &#x000bd; to 1 lb/week and a 10 percent weight loss in 6 months. For more severely obese patients with BMIs &#x02265; 35, deficits of up to 500 to 1,000 kcal/day will lead to weight losses of about 1 to 2 lb/week and a 10 percent weight loss in 6 months.</p><div id="A309.sec0" class="box"><h3><span class="title">Evidence Statement</span></h3><p><i>Weight loss at the rate of 1 to 2 lb/week (calorie deficit of 500 to 1,000 kcal/day) commonly occurs for up to 6 months, at which point weight loss begins to plateau unless a more restrictive regimen is implemented. Evidence Category B.</i></p></div><p><b>Rationale:</b> To achieve significant weight loss, an energy deficit must be created and maintained. Weight can be lost at a rate of 1 to 2 lb/week with a calorie deficit of 500 to 1,000 kcal/day. After 6 months, this caloric deficit theoretically should result in a loss of 26 to 52 lb. However, the average amount of weight lost actually observed over this time period usually is in the range of 20 to 25 lb. A greater rate of weight loss does not yield a better result at the end of 1 year [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1520" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1520/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">437</a>]. It is difficult for most patients to continue to lose weight after a period of 6 months due to changes in resting metabolic rates and difficulty in adhering to treatment strategies, although some can do so. To continue to lose weight, diet and physical activity goals need to be revised to create an energy deficit at the lower weight, since energy requirements decrease as weight is decreased. To achieve additional weight loss, the patient must further decrease calories and/or increase physical activity. Many studies show that rapid weight reduction almost always is followed by regaining of weight. Moreover, with rapid weight reduction, there is an increased risk for gallstones and, possibly, electrolyte abnormalities.</p><div id="A309.sec1" class="box"><h3><span class="title">RECOMMENDATION</span></h3><p><i>Weight loss should be about 1 to 2 lb/week for a period of 6 months with the subsequent strategy based on the amount of weight lost.

Weight Maintenance at Lower Weight</h3><p>Once the goals of weight loss have been successfully achieved, maintenance of a lower body weight becomes a major challenge. In the past, obtaining the goal of weight loss has been considered the end of weight loss therapy. Unfortunately, once patients are dismissed from clinical therapy, they frequently regain the lost weight.

The primary care practitioner and patient should recognize that at this point, weight maintenance, the second phase of the weight loss effort, should take priority. Successful weight maintenance is defined as a weight regain of &#x0003c; 3 kg (6.6 lb) in 2 years and a sustained reduction in waist circumference of at least 4 cm. If a patient wishes to lose more weight after a period of weight maintenance, the procedure for weight loss outlined above can be repeated.</p><div id="A310.sec1" class="box"><h3><span class="title">RECOMMENDATION</span></h3><p><i>A weight maintenance program should be a priority after the initial 6 months of weight loss therapy.

Long-term monitoring and encouragement can be accomplished in several ways: by regular clinic visits, at group meetings, or via telephone or E-mail. The longer the weight maintenance phase can be sustained, the better the prospects for long-term success in weight reduction.

Prevention of Further Weight Gain</h3><p>Some patients may not be able to achieve significant weight reduction. In such patients, an important goal is to prevent further weight gain that would exacerbate disease risk. Thus, prevention of further weight gain may justify entering a patient into weight loss therapy. Prevention of further weight gain can be considered a partial therapeutic success for many patients. Moreover, if further weight gain can be prevented, this achievement may be an important first step toward beginning the weight loss process. Primary care practitioners ought to recognize the importance of this goal for those patients who are not able to immediately lose weight. The need to prevent weight gain may warrant maintaining patients in a weight management program for an extended period.</p></div></div><div id="A312"><h2 id="_A312_">H. Strategies for Weight Loss and Weight Maintenance</h2><div id="A313"><h3>1. Dietary Therapy</h3><p>In the majority of overweight and obese patients, adjustment of the diet to reduce caloric intake will be required. Dietary therapy consists, in large part, of instructing patients on how to modify their diets to achieve a decrease in caloric intake. A key element of the current recommendation is the use of a moderate reduction in caloric intake to achieve a slow but progressive weight loss. Ideally, caloric intake should be reduced only to the level required to maintain weight at the desired level. If this level of caloric intake is achieved, excess weight will gradually disappear. In practice, somewhat greater caloric deficits are used in the period of active weight loss, but diets with very low calories are to be avoided. Finally the composition of the diet should be modified to minimize other cardiovascular risk factors [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1225" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1225/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">142</a>].</p><p>The centerpiece of dietary therapy for weight loss in overweight patients is a low-calorie diet (<a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d70/">LCD</a>) (800 to 1,500 kcal/day).

LCDs have been shown to reduce total body weight by an average of 8 percent over a period of 6 months, accompanied by significant reductions in waist circumference. Since this represents an average that includes individuals who did not lose weight, an individual average goal of 10 percent is feasible. When weight loss occurs, the loss consists of about 75 percent fat and 25 percent lean tissue [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1639" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1639/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">556</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1640" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1640/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">557</a>].

These authorities note that total caloric intake has not increased over the last few decades; instead, the caloric imbalance leading to overweight and obesity is the result of a substantial decrease in physical activity and, consequently, a decrease in daily energy expenditure. However, this hypothesis is difficult to prove because appropriate data are lacking.

However, it is not known whether the effects of physical activity on abdominal fat are independent of weight loss.</p><div id="A326"><h4>2.a. Strategies to increase physical activity</h4><p>Many people live sedentary lives, have little training or skills in physical activity, and are difficult to motivate toward increasing their activity. For these reasons, starting a physical activity regimen may require supervision for some people. The need to avoid injury during physical activity is high. Extremely obese persons may need to start with simple exercises that can gradually be intensified. The practitioner must decide whether exercise testing for cardiopulmonary disease is needed before embarking on a new physical activity regimen. This decision should be based on a patient's age, symptoms, and concomitant risk factors.</p><p>For most obese patients, physical activity should be initiated slowly, and the intensity should be increased gradually. Initial activities may be walking or swimming at a slow pace. With time, depending on progress, the amount of weight lost, and functional capacity, the patient may engage in more strenuous activities. Some of these include fitness walking, cycling, rowing, cross-country skiing, aerobic dancing, and rope jumping. Jogging provides a high-intensity aerobic exercise, but can lead to orthopedic injury. If jogging is desired, the patient's ability to do this must first be assessed. The availability of a safe environment for the jogger is also a necessity. Competitive sports, such as tennis and volleyball, can provide an enjoyable form of physical activity for many, but again, care must be taken to avoid injury, especially in older people. As the examples listed in <a class="figpopup" href="/books/NBK2004/table/A327/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA327" rid-ob="figobA327">Table IV-4</a> show, a moderate amount of physical activity can be achieved in a variety of ways. People can select activities that they enjoy and that fit into their daily lives. Because amounts of activity are functions of duration, intensity, and frequency, the same amounts of activity can be obtained in longer sessions of moderately intense activities (such as brisk walking) as in shorter sessions of more strenuous activities (such as running).</p><div class="iconblock whole_rhythm clearfix ten_col table-wrap" id="figA327"><a href="/books/NBK2004/table/A327/?report=objectonly" target="object" title="Table IV-4" class="img_link icnblk_img figpopup" rid-figpopup="figA327" rid-ob="figobA327"><img class="small-thumb" src="/books/NBK2004/table/A327/?report=thumb" src-large="/books/NBK2004/table/A327/?report=previmg" alt="Table IV-4.

The patient can start by walking 10 minutes, 3 days a week, and can build to 30 to 45 minutes of more intense walking at least 5 days a week and preferably most, if not all, days [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1660" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1660/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">577</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1661" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1661/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">578</a>]. With this regimen, an additional 100 to 200 calories per day of physical activity can be expended. Caloric expenditure will vary depending on the individual's body weight and intensity of the activity (see <a class="figpopup" href="/books/NBK2004/table/A328/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA328" rid-ob="figobA328">Table IV-5</a>).</p><div class="iconblock whole_rhythm clearfix ten_col table-wrap" id="figA328"><a href="/books/NBK2004/table/A328/?report=objectonly" target="object" title="Table IV-5" class="img_link icnblk_img figpopup" rid-figpopup="figA328" rid-ob="figobA328"><img class="small-thumb" src="/books/NBK2004/table/A328/?report=thumb" src-large="/books/NBK2004/table/A328/?report=previmg" alt="Table IV-5.

With time, a larger weekly volume of physical activity can be performed that would normally cause a greater weight loss if it were not compensated by a higher caloric intake.</p><p>Reducing sedentary time is another approach to increasing activity. Patients should be encouraged to build physical activities into each day. Examples include leaving public transportation one stop before the usual one, parking further than usual from work or shopping, and walking up stairs instead of taking elevators or escalators. New forms of physical activity should be suggested, e.g., gardening, walking a dog daily, or new athletic activities. Engaging in physical activity can be facilitated by identifying a safe area to perform the activity, e.g., community parks, gyms, pools, and health clubs. However, when these sites are not available, an area of the home can be identified and perhaps outfitted with equipment such as a stationary bicycle or a treadmill.</p><p>Health professionals should encourage patients to plan and schedule physical activity 1 week in advance, budget the time necessary to do it, and document their physical activity by keeping a diary and recording the duration and intensity of exercise.</p><div id="A326.sec0" class="box"><h3><span class="title">RECOMMENDATION</span></h3><p><i>Physical activity should be an integral part of weight loss therapy and weight maintenance.

With the publication of the trials with phentermine and fenfluramine by Weintraub in 1992 (210 weeks), drug therapy began to change from short-term to long-term use. Both dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine alone, as well as the combination of phentermine/fenfluramine, were used long term. However, concerns about recently reported unacceptable side effects, such as valvular lesions of the heart causing significant insufficiency of the valves [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1741" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1741/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">658</a>], have led to the withdrawal of the drugs dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine from the market in September 1997 [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1844" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1844/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">761</a>]. No drugs remained that were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use longer than 3 months.

Because of the tendency to regain weight after weight loss, the use of long-term medication to aid in the treatment of obesity may be indicated in carefully selected patients.</p><p>The drugs used to promote weight loss have been anorexiants or appetite suppressants. Three classes of anorexiant drugs have been developed, all of which affect neurotransmitters in the brain: those that affect catecholamines, those that affect serotonin, and those that affect both. They work by increasing the secretion of dopamine, norepinephrine, or serotonin into the synaptic neural cleft, or by inhibiting the reuptake of these neurotransmitters back into the neuron, or by both mechanisms. The new agent sibutramine has norepinephrine and serotonin effects. Another new agent, orlistat, has a different mechanism of action, the blockage of fat absorption. Very few trials longer than 6 months have been done with any drug.

There are few long-term studies evaluating the safety or effectiveness of many currently approved weight loss medications. At present, sibutramine is available for long-term use. (Note: FDA approval for orlistat is pending a resolution of labeling issues and results of Phase III trials.)

If a patient does not lose 2 kg (4.4 lb) in the first 4 weeks after initiating therapy, the likelihood of long-term response is very low [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1590" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1590/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">507</a>]. This finding may be used as a guide to treatment, either continuing medication in the responders or stopping it in the nonresponders. If weight is lost in the initial 6 months of therapy or is maintained after the initial weight loss phase, this should be considered a success, and the drug may be continued. It is important to remember that the major role of medications should be to help patients stay on a diet and physical activity plan while losing weight. Medication cannot be expected to continue to be effective in weight loss or weight maintenance once it has been stopped [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1673" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1673/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">590</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1674" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1674/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">591</a>]. The use of the drug may be continued as long as it is effective and the adverse effects are manageable and not serious. There are no indications for specifying how long a weight loss drug should be continued. Therefore, an initial trial period of several weeks with a given drug or combination of drugs may help determine their efficacy in a given patient. If a patient does not respond to a drug with reasonable weight loss, the physician should reassess the patient to determine adherence to the medication regimen and adjunctive therapies, or consider the need for dosage adjustment. If the patient continues to be unresponsive to the medication, or serious adverse effects occur, the physician should consider its discontinuation [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1675" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1675/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">592</a>].</p><div id="A344.sec2" class="box"><h3><span class="title">Evidence Statement</span></h3><p><i>Adverse side effects from the use of weight loss drugs have been observed in patients.

Thus, a multivitamin supplement is recommended. Side effects are generally mild and may improve with continued use, although their persistence may result in discontinuation of the drug.</p><p>There is a great interest in weight loss drugs among consumers. Because of the possibility of serious adverse effects, it is incumbent on the practitioner to use drug therapy with caution. Practitioners should be sure that patients are not taking drugs that have been withdrawn from the market for safety reasons, and herbal medications are not recommended as part of a weight loss program. These preparations have unpredictable amounts of active ingredients and unpredictable and potentially harmful effects. <i>In those patients with a lower level of obesity risk, nonpharmacological therapy is the treatment of choice.</i> It is important for the physician to monitor both the effectiveness and the side effects of the drug.</p><div id="A344.sec3" class="box"><h3><span class="title">Evidence Statement</span></h3><p><i>Using weight loss drugs singly (not in combination) and starting with the lowest effective doses can decrease the likelihood of adverse effects. Evidence Category C.</i></p></div><p><b>Rationale:</b> Given the fact that adverse events may increase in association with combination drug therapy, it seems wise that, until further safety data are available, using weight loss drugs singly would be more prudent. Some patients will respond to lower doses, so that full dosage is not always necessary. The short-term use of drugs (&#x0003c; 3 months) has not generally been found to be effective.</p><p>Drugs should be used only as part of a comprehensive program that includes behavior therapy, diet, and physical activity. Appropriate monitoring for side effects must be continued while drugs are part of the regimen. Patients will need to return for followup in 2 to 4 weeks, then monthly for 3 months, and then every 3 months for the first year after starting the medication. After the first year, the doctor will advise the patient on appropriate return visits. The purposes of these visits are to monitor weight, blood pressure, and pulse, discuss side effects, conduct laboratory tests, and answer questions.</p><p>Since obesity is a chronic disorder, the short-term use of drugs is not helpful. The health professional should include drugs only in the context of a long-term treatment strategy [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1676" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1676/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">593</a>].

The aim of surgery is to modify the gastrointestinal tract to reduce net food intake. Most authorities agree that weight loss surgery should be reserved for patients with severe obesity, in whom efforts at other therapy have failed, and who are suffering from the complications of obesity.</p><p>Considerable progress has been made in developing safer and more effective surgical procedures for promoting weight loss. Surgical interventions commonly used include gastroplasty, gastric partitioning, and gastric bypass. These procedures are designed primarily to reduce food consumption. They have replaced previous procedures that were designed to promote malabsorption of nutrients. The latter procedures were fraught with side effects that made their use impractical or dangerous.</p><div id="A346.sec0" class="box"><h3><span class="title">Evidence Statement</span></h3><p><i>Gastrointestinal surgery (gastric restriction [vertical gastric banding] or gastric bypass [Roux-en Y]) can result in substantial weight loss, and therefore is an available weight loss option for well-informed and motivated patients with a <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d10/">BMI</a> &#x02265; 40 or &#x02265; 35, who have comorbid conditions and acceptable operative risks.

Thus, treatment of clinically severe obesity involves an effort to create a caloric deficit sufficient to result in weight loss and reduction of weight-associated risk factors or comorbidities. Surgical approaches can result in substantial weight loss, i.e., from 50 kg (110 lb) to as much as 100 kg (220 lb) over a period of 6 months to 1 year. A major limitation of nonsurgical approaches is the failure to maintain reduced body weight in many individuals.</p><p><a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d117/">Surgical procedures</a> in current use (gastric restriction [vertical gastric banding] and gastric bypass [Roux-en Y]) can induce substantial weight loss, and serve to reduce weight-associated risk factors and comorbidities. Compared to other interventions available, surgery has produced the longest period of sustained weight loss. Assessing both perioperative risk and long-term complications is important and requires assessing the risk/benefit ratio in each case. Patients whose <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d10/">BMI</a> equals or exceeds 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> are potential candidates for surgery if they strongly desire substantial weight loss, because obesity severely impairs the quality of their lives. Less severe obese patients (BMIs between 35 and 39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) also may be considered for surgery. This group primarily includes those patients with high-risk comorbid conditions (cardiovascular, sleep apnea, uncontrolled type 2 diabetes) or weight-induced physical problems interfering with performance of daily life activities.</p><p>A recent retrospective study of severely overweight patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes, who were referred for consideration of a gastric bypass procedure, allowed for a comparison of those who opted for the surgical procedure versus those who did not undergo the procedure because of personal preference or refusal of insurance payment. Patients undergoing the surgical procedure had a decrease in mortality rate for each year of follow up [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1677" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1677/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">594</a>].

It is, however, difficult to determine from the literature how often this occurs and whether it makes weight loss programs more effective. Very few published reports of such adapted programs can be identified, particularly when a distinction is made from reports that include or focus on special populations but do not report any particular steps taken to modify the intervention for these populations. In addition, it is impossible to compare directly the amount of weight lost using specially adapted programs with that achieved when more standard approaches are used. Studies reporting these programs are sometimes pilot studies or descriptive reports that do not meet the standards of evidence set forth elsewhere in these guidelines. Where randomized controlled trials or quasi-experiments are available, they usually do not include an internal comparison with a program involving no adaptations. <a href="/books/n/obesity/A523/">Appendix III</a> illustrates the types of adaptations that have been reported.</i></p><p><i>Large individual variation exists within any social or cultural group; furthermore, there is substantial overlap among subcultures within the larger society.

Also, weight loss at older ages has been associated with increased mortality [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1401" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1401/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">318</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1686" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1686/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">603&#x02013;607</a>]. Some of the association of weight loss with higher mortality may be due to the increased frequency at older ages of involuntary weight loss due to identified or occult illness. In any case, the association of weight loss with higher mortality applies most clearly to individuals who enter old age with a <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d10/">BMI</a> in the lower part of the range. It is not clear that it applies to overweight older persons with <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d14/">CVD</a> risk factors. This issue has been difficult to clarify in observational data, but there are no randomized trials in which the effects of obesity treatment on mortality can be directly assessed, at any age.</i></p><p><i>The wisdom or importance of treating obesity at older ages has also been questioned because of epidemiological observations suggesting a decreased significance of obesity-related relative risks at older ages (see <a href="/books/n/obesity/A127/">chapter 2</a>.3.b.). However, these relative-risk data are not a useful reference point for considering whether obese older persons will benefit. Relative risks are influenced by the characteristics of the comparison group. In this case, the comparison group is lower-weight older persons who have also had high morbidity and mortality.</i></p><p><i>Concerns about potential adverse effects of obesity treatment in older adults have been raised with respect to bone health and to dietary adequacy. Weight reduction may accelerate aging-related bone loss and thereby increase the risk of osteoporotic fractures in high-risk groups such as older white women [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1691" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1691/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">608&#x02013;610</a>]. This concern is more relevant to weight loss in thin persons than in obese persons. Some evidence suggests that including resistance training and moderate weight-bearing exercise as a part of a weight reduction program may help maintain bone integrity [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1694" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1694/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">611</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1695" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1695/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">612</a>].</i></p><p><i>The general nutritional safety of weight reduction at older ages is of interest because restrictions on overall food intake due to dieting could result in inadequate intakes of protein or essential vitamins and minerals. In addition, involuntary weight loss indicative of occult disease might be mistaken for success in voluntary weight reduction. These concerns can be alleviated by providing proper nutritional counseling and regular body weight monitoring for older persons for whom weight reduction is prescribed.</i></p></div><div id="A348.sec1" class="box"><h3><span class="title">Evidence Statement</span></h3><p><i>Age alone should not preclude treatment for obesity in adult men and women.

Smoking Cessation in the Overweight or Obese Patient</h2><p>Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for cardiopulmonary disease. Because of its attendant high risk, smoking cessation is a major goal of risk-factor management. This aim is especially important in the overweight or obese patient, who usually carries excess risk from obesity-associated risk factors. Thus, smoking cessation in such patients becomes a high priority for risk reduction.</p><div id="A368.sec0" class="box"><h3><span class="title">Evidence Statement</span></h3><p><i>Smoking and obesity together increase cardiovascular risk, but fear of weight gain upon smoking cessation is an obstacle for many patients who smoke. Evidence Category C.</i></p></div><p><b>Rationale:</b> Both smoking and obesity are accompanied by increased risks for cardiovascular disease. Many well-documented health benefits are associated with smoking cessation, but a major obstacle to successful smoking cessation has been the attendant weight gain observed in about 80 percent of quitters. This weight gain averages 4.5 to 7 lb, but in 13 percent of women and 10 percent of men, weight gains in excess of 28 lb have been noted among quitters [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1696" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1696/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">613&#x02013;615</a>].

Postcessation weight gain has been associated with a reduction in energy expenditure of up to 100 kcal/day, accounting for approximately one-third of the weight gain after smoking cessation [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1703" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1703/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">620</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1704" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1704/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">621</a>].

In general, no differences in the level of physical activity have been observed after smoking cessation. About two-thirds of the weight gain after smoking cessation appears to result from increased caloric intake [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1704" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1704/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">621&#x02013;623</a>]. However, dietary counseling programs combined with smoking cessation programs have not been very successful. There are several products that reduce postcessation weight gain during drug administration, including nicotine replacement therapy [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1707" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1707/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">624</a>], phenylpropanol-amine [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1708" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1708/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">625</a>], and bupropion [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1709" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1709/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">626</a>]. No matter what the drug, however, it appears that these drugs merely delay rather than prevent postcessation weight gain. That is, while providing weight gain suppression during drug administration, subjects on these drugs experience a rebound of weight gain once they go off the products and long-term weight gain is equal to that in those not receiving these drugs [<a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1707" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1707/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">624</a>, <a href="/books/n/obesity/A1083/#A1709" data-bk-pop-rid="/books/n/obesity/A1083/def-item/A1709/" data-bk-pop-others="" class="bk_pop">626</a>].</p><p>The weight gained with smoking cessation is less likely to produce negative health consequences than would continued smoking. For this reason, smoking cessation should be strongly reinforced in persons regardless of their baseline weight. Smoking is not an acceptable weight control therapy, although it seems to be used for this purpose by a great many people. <a class="def" href="/books/n/obesity/A861b/def-item/app1h.g1-d88/">Overweight</a> patients, as well as all others, should be counseled to quit smoking. For practical reasons, it may be prudent to avoid initiating smoking cessation and weight loss therapy simutaneously. Prevention of weight gain through diet and physical activity should be stressed. If weight gain ensues after smoking cessation, it should be managed vigorously according to the guidelines outlined in this report. Although short-term weight gain is a common side effect of smoking cessation, this gain does not rule out the possibility of long-term weight control.
