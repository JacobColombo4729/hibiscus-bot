## Background 
HibiscusBot is an application developed on the [Chainlit](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit) framework and powered by a foundation model provided by [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). It's a specialized large language model optimized for nutritional support and meal planning tasks.
