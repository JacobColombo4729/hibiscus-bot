<p>The <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025</em> was
issued jointly by the US Departments of Agriculture and of Health and Human
Services in December 2020. It is the ninth edition of the <em>Dietary
Guidelines</em> and is the first to provide recommendations by life
stage, from birth to older adulthood. The <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> is
grounded in the current body of scientific evidence on diet and health outcomes
and aims to promote health and prevent chronic diseases. The process to develop
the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> involved 4 steps: (1) identifying the
topics and supporting scientific questions, (2) appointing a Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee (Committee) to review current scientific evidence, (3)
developing the new edition of the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em>, and (4)
implementing the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em>. The 2020-2025 edition
provides 4 overarching guidelines and supporting key recommendations that
encourage healthy dietary patterns across the life span. The foods and beverages
that people consume have a profound impact on health, and it is never too late
or too early to eat healthfully.</p></section><hr class="headless">
<p>The <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025</em>
(<em>Dietary Guidelines</em>) includes an important call to action for
health professionals and policymakers, to help the public “make every bite
count.”<sup><a href="#bib1" class="usa-link" aria-describedby="bib1">1</a></sup> This
article provides an overview of the recommendations in the recent edition and
background on the scientific review process that informed the development of the
<em>Dietary Guidelines</em>.</p>
<p>The US Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and of Health and Human Services (HHS)
update the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> every 5 years, based on the current
science. Although many recommendations have remained relatively consistent over
time, the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> also has evolved as scientific
knowledge has grown. The <em>2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans</em> reflects this in 3 important ways. The first is its
recognition that diet-related chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type
2 diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer, are very prevalent among Americans
and pose a major public health problem. A fundamental premise of the <em>Dietary
Guidelines</em> is that everyone, no matter their age, race, or ethnicity,
economic circumstances, or health status, can benefit from shifting food and
beverage choices to better support healthy dietary patterns. The second is its focus
on dietary patterns. Researchers and public health experts understand that nutrients
and foods are not consumed in isolation. Rather, people consume them in various
combinations over time—a dietary pattern—and these foods and beverages
act synergistically to affect health. The <em>2020–2025 Dietary
Guidelines</em> carries forward this emphasis on the importance of a healthy
dietary pattern as a whole—rather than on individual nutrients, foods, or
food groups in isolation. The third is its focus on a life span approach. This
edition of the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> highlights the importance of
encouraging healthy dietary patterns at every life stage from infancy through older
adulthood. For the first time since the 1985 edition, the <em>2020–2025
Dietary Guidelines</em> includes recommendations for healthy dietary
patterns for infants and toddlers.</p>
<section id="sec1"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">PURPOSE OF THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS</h2>
<p>The <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> provides science-based advice on what to eat
and drink to promote health, help reduce the risk of chronic disease, and meet
nutrient needs. It serves as the cornerstone of federal nutrition programs and
policies and is mandated by law to reflect the preponderance of scientific evidence
and to be published by USDA and HHS at least every 5 years.<sup><a href="#bib2" class="usa-link" aria-describedby="bib2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>As an important part of a complex, multifaceted approach to promote health and reduce
chronic disease risk, the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> is written for a
professional audience, including policymakers, healthcare professionals, nutrition
educators, and federal nutrition program operators. Health professionals are a
critically important audience who work with the public to help them consume a
healthy and nutritionally adequate diet. Comprehensive, coordinated strategies built
on the science-based foundation of the <em>Dietary
Guidelines</em>—and a commitment to drive these strategies over time
across sectors and settings—can help all Americans consume healthy dietary
patterns, achieve and maintain good health, and reduce the risk of chronic
diseases.</p></section><section id="sec2"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">DIETARY GUIDELINES PROCESS</h2>
<p>The process to develop the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> has evolved over time,
in step with developments in nutrition science, public health, and best practices in
scientific review and guidance development. In establishing the process for the
<em>2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines</em>, USDA and HHS considered
and integrated recommendations from a comprehensive 2017 National Academies'
study, “Review of the Process to Update the Dietary
Guidelines.”<sup><a href="#bib3" class="usa-link" aria-describedby="bib3">3</a></sup>
Greater transparency figured prominently in the Academies' recommendations.
As a result, USDA and HHS made significant changes to increase transparency and
public participation while maintaining the core element of scientific integrity.</p>
<p>The 2020–2025 process consisted of 4 stages: (1) identifying the topics and
supporting scientific questions to be examined, (2) appointing a Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee (Committee) to review current scientific evidence and develop a
scientific report, (3) developing the new edition of the <em>Dietary
Guidelines</em>, and (4) implementing the <em>Dietary
Guidelines</em> through federal programs and nonfederal program entities
(Figure <a href="#F1" class="usa-link">1</a>).</p>

Americans</em>.</p></figcaption></figure><section id="sec3"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Identifying Scientific Topics and Questions</h3>
<p>The Departments added a new first step of identifying topics and scientific
questions to begin the process of developing the next <em>Dietary
Guidelines</em>. This step was added to promote a deliberate and
transparent process, better define the expertise needed on the Committee, ensure
the scientific review conducted by the Committee would address federal nutrition
policy and program needs, and help manage resources. Topics and questions were
made available for the public to view and provide comments. The USDA and HHS
considered each public and agency comment to refine the topics and questions.
Final topics and questions were posted along with the public call for
nominations to the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.</p></section><section id="sec4"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report
Development</h3>
<p>In the second stage, the Secretaries of USDA and HHS appointed the Committee with
the single, time-limited task of reviewing the <em>2015–2020 Dietary
Guidelines</em>, examining the evidence on the selected nutrition and
public health topics and scientific questions, and providing independent,
science-based advice and recommendations to USDA and HHS. The Committee was
announced in February and appointed at the first public meeting in March 2019.
Public comments were accepted throughout the process. The Committee met a total
of 6 times. The Committee timeline was extended by 1 month because of the impact
of COVID-19 (Figure <a href="#F2" class="usa-link">2</a>).</p>

<figcaption><p>The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee timeline.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The 20 nationally recognized scientific experts appointed to the Committee
represented a mix of practitioners, epidemiologists, scientists, clinical trial
experts, and others from every region of the United States. This is the largest
Committee to date because of the additional emphasis on infants, toddlers, and
pregnant women. The Committee members were selected on predetermined criteria
including educational background, professional experience, scientific expertise,
obligations under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and requirements regarding
a balanced membership. The USDA and HHS not only examined nomination packages
individually to ensure each person met the criteria but also considered how a
potential candidate's expertise fits with other members of the Committee
to ensure a balanced committee with expertise across the topic areas.</p>
<p>The Committee's work had 3 defining characteristics: the use of 3
approaches to examine the evidence, the creation of transparent protocols before
the evidence review began, and the development of scientific review conclusion
statements. The Committee answered each question on diet and health using 1 of 3
approaches: data analysis, food pattern modeling, and Nutrition Evidence
Systematic Review (NESR) systematic reviews. Each of these approaches has its
own rigorous, protocol-driven methodology and plays a unique, complementary role
in examining the science.</p>
<ul class="list" style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><p><strong>Data analysis:</strong> The method of data analysis includes a
collection of analyses that uses national data sets to describe and
understand the current health and dietary intakes of Americans. These
data help make the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> practical,
relevant, and achievable. The Committee conducted more than 150 analyses
of federal data sets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Food pattern modeling:</strong> Food pattern modeling shows how
changes to the amounts or types of foods and beverages in a pattern may
impact meeting nutrient needs across the US population. Several food
pattern modeling analyses were completed including, for the first time,
analyses of food patterns for children from 6 to 24 months old.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>NESR systematic reviews:</strong> NESR systematic reviews are
research projects that answer a question on diet and health by searching
for, evaluating, and synthesizing all relevant, peer-reviewed studies
within a specified period. More than 270 000 citations were screened,
and nearly 1500 original research articles were included in 33 original
systematic reviews.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The 2020 Committee created a protocol for each question, with support from USDA
and HHS staff, before it examined any of the scientific evidence. This protocol
served as a plan to examine research related to each of the questions (eg,
inclusion/exclusion criteria for study design and date of publication).</p>
<p>The Committee looked across all of the conclusion statements—the totality
of the scientific review—to develop overarching advice for USDA and HHS
to consider as the Departments developed the <em>2020–2025 Dietary
Guidelines</em>. For example, the Committee reviewed 8 specific
questions on dietary patterns related to health outcomes such as cardiovascular
disease, risk of overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, bone health, cancer,
neurocognitive health, and all-cause mortality. The Committee found consistent
evidence that certain dietary components are associated with multiple outcomes
and based their advice to the Department on this consistent evidence.</p>
<blockquote class="text-italic"><p>The updated process for developing the <em>Dietary Guidelines for
Americans</em> increased transparency and public participation, as
well as ensured that the scientific review conducted by the Committee would
address federal nutrition policy and program needs and help manage
resources.</p></blockquote></section><section id="sec5"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee</h3>
<p>The Committee's work culminated in the release of the <em>Scientific
Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee</em> posted at
<a href="http://DietaryGuidelines.gov" class="usa-link usa-link--external" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DietaryGuidelines.gov</a> on July 15, 2020.<sup><a href="#bib4" class="usa-link" aria-describedby="bib4">4</a></sup> There were more than 10 000
downloads for this document in the first week.</p>
<p>As part of the Committee's scientific review, the report summarizes
current intakes of foods, beverages, and nutrients across the life span. It is
interesting to note that what Americans eat has not changed appreciably for the
past decade. Throughout their life span, Americans overconsume calories,
saturated fats, sodium, added sugars, and alcohol. In addition, they
underconsume fruits, vegetables, dairy, and whole grains compared with
recommendations. The report also identifies nutrients or food components of
public health concern due to underconsumption, where inadequacy of those
nutrients is linked to specific health conditions. This is based on intake data
and evidence through biochemical indices or functional status indicators. These
nutrients or food components are of public health concern for all Americans:
vitamin D, calcium, dietary fiber, and potassium.</p>
<p>The Committee reviewed evidence on the relationship between nutrition and health
outcomes for the entire life span from infants to older adults and including
pregnancy and lactation. The report emphasized the importance of consuming a
healthy dietary pattern at every life stage to meet nutrient needs, maintain
proper growth or energy balance, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.</p></section></section><section id="sec6"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">PREGNANT AND LACTATING WOMEN</h2>
<p>The evidence reviewed by the Committee reinforces the importance of nutrition for
women before and during pregnancy and lactation for optimal maternal and fetal
outcomes. The Committee concluded that consuming a healthy dietary pattern before
and/or during pregnancy may modestly reduce the risk of gestational diabetes,
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, excessive gestational weight gain, and preterm
birth. For both pregnancy and lactation, the Committee's review suggested
that seafood choices are important components of a healthy dietary pattern along
with other core components, including vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains,
low-fat or nonfat dairy, lean meat and poultry, nuts, and unsaturated vegetable
oils.</p>
<p>On the basis of intake data, biomarker data, and clinical outcomes, women who are
pregnant or lactating have similar food components of public health concern (vitamin
D, calcium, dietary fiber, and potassium) as the rest of the population, but iron
and folate/folic acid status is also of particular importance during pregnancy.
Without supplements and careful food choices, women who are pregnant are at a high
risk for inadequacy for these nutrients. The Committee determined that, during
pregnancy and lactation, consuming a healthy dietary pattern (Healthy US-Style,
Healthy Vegetarian, and Healthy Mediterranean-Style) would meet most nutrient needs.
During pregnancy, women should also specifically incorporate foods rich in iron,
folate, choline, and vitamins D and E. During lactation, foods rich in choline, and
vitamins A, D, and E are important to incorporate. Because iron needs are lower
during lactation compared with pregnancy, research supports the discontinuation of
prenatal high–iron-dose supplements during lactation unless medically
indicated.</p>
<p>The Committee's review also indicated that the avoidance of potentially
allergenic foods during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended, unless medically
necessary to protect the mother's health. The Committee recommended that
women follow existing guidance on alcohol and caffeine consumption during pregnancy
and lactation and emphasized that maintaining a healthy prepregnancy weight,
achieving appropriate weight gain during lactation, and returning to a healthy
weight during the postpartum period are essential.</p></section><section id="sec7"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">INFANTS AND TODDLERS</h2>
<p>The Committee encouraged exclusive breastfeeding, ideally for the first 6 months of
life, with continued breastfeeding through the first year of life or longer as
desired by the mother and infant. On the basis of the evidence reviewed, the
Committee concluded that complementary foods and beverages (CFB) should not be
introduced before 4 months old. The Committee found that introduction at 4 to 5
months old as compared with 6 months old does not offer long-term advantages or
disadvantages. It recommended that CFB include foods that are rich in iron and zinc,
either intrinsically (eg, meats) or due to fortification (eg, iron-fortified infant
cereal), particularly from the age of 6 to 12 months among breastfed infants.
Complementary foods and beverages should also contain adequate amounts of
polyunsaturated fatty acids. The Committee concluded that, once CFB are introduced,
adding peanut and egg in developmentally appropriate forms in the first year of life
(6-12 months old) may reduce the risk of food allergy to these foods. The Committee
found no evidence that avoiding other potentially allergenic foods (fish, shellfish,
cow milk products, tree nuts, seeds, wheat, and soy) in the first year of life is
beneficial with regard to preventing food allergies or other atopic diseases.</p>
<p>On the basis of its evidence review, the Committee concluded that routine iron
supplementation of all breastfed infants may not be advisable, although it
acknowledged that screening for iron deficiency using appropriate biomarkers, such
as serum ferritin, may be challenging because it is not as simple as measuring
hemoglobin. After 6 months, other sources of iron, such as iron-rich or
iron-fortified complementary foods, can be provided, so iron supplementation is
generally not needed. The Committee also concluded that there is no basis for
recommending vitamin D supplementation higher than 400 IU per day during
infancy.</p>
<p>The Committee conducted food pattern modeling to determine whether USDA food patterns
could be established for infants and toddlers ages 6 to 24 months.<sup><a href="#bib5" class="usa-link" aria-describedby="bib5">5</a></sup> A food pattern for infants 6 to 12
months old could not be established because of challenges with uncertainty about
nutrient requirements and difficulty in meeting the Recommended Dietary Allowance
for iron through CFB. However, combinations of CFB were described by the Committee
that meet most nutrient requirements while infants are still consuming different
proportions of human milk or infant formula. The Committee recommended providing
infants and toddlers with a variety of animal-source foods (meat, poultry, seafood,
eggs, and dairy), fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and whole-grain products,
beginning at 6 to 12 months old and continuing thereafter. For toddlers 12 to 24
months old whose diets do not include meat, poultry, or seafood, the Committee
advised providing eggs and dairy products on a regular basis, along with soy
products and nuts or seeds, fruits, vegetables, grains, and oils. The Committee also
recommended not providing foods and beverages with added sugars, such as
sugar-sweetened beverages, to children younger than 2 months because energy from
added sugars is likely to displace energy from nutrient-dense foods and because some
evidence suggests a relationship with subsequent risk of child overweight. In
addition, because food preferences begin at an early age, it is important to
encourage regular consumption of nutrient-dense foods and beverages.</p></section><section id="sec8"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">TWO YEARS AND OLDER</h2>
<p>The Committee's extensive evidence review found that dietary patterns higher
in vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, low-fat or nonfat dairy, lean meat and
poultry, seafood, nuts, and unsaturated vegetable oils, and low in red and processed
meats, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, and refined grains are associated with a
range of beneficial health outcomes. Beneficial outcomes associated with these
healthy dietary patterns include reduced risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
disease, type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity, bone health, and several cancers.
These core dietary pattern elements are appropriate across the life span from
children to older adults.</p>
<p>On the basis of its review of the evidence for a relationship between types of
dietary fats consumed and cardiovascular disease risk, the Committee advised
limiting intake of saturated fats to less than 10% of energy per day by replacing
them with unsaturated fats and keeping dietary cholesterol intake as low as
possible. The Committee also recommended 2 or more servings of cooked seafood per
week for individuals 2 years and older to ensure intake of key nutrients and as part
of an overall healthy dietary pattern. Serving sizes vary based on age and seafood
choices should emphasize species higher in omega-3 fatty acids and low in
methylmercury, following federal and local fish and seafood advisories.<sup><a href="#bib6" class="usa-link" aria-describedby="bib6">6</a></sup> For those who do not consume
seafood, the Committee concluded that regular intake of other foods high in omega-3
fatty acids, such as flaxseeds, walnuts, soy oil, algae, and eggs that contain
omega-3 fatty acids, is appropriate.</p>
<p>The Committee also examined the relationship between beverage consumption and weight
status. It concluded that nutrient-rich beverages (eg, fat-free or low-fat milk,
100% juice) contribute substantively to food group and nutrient intakes but that it
is important to be mindful of their contribution to total energy intake. Because
sugar-sweetened beverages contribute substantial energy to the diet and contribute
very little toward meeting food group and nutrient recommendations, the Committee
encouraged only limited intake of these beverages. The Committee acknowledged that
low- and no-calorie sweetened beverages may be a useful aid in weight management in
adults, but that evidence was limited. The Committee emphasized that the role
beverages play in diet quality and energy balance varies across the life span and
that recommendations should be tailored appropriately.</p>
<p>On the basis of its review of the evidence regarding alcohol consumption, the
Committee concluded that, for those who do not drink, it is not wise to begin
drinking alcohol or purposefully continue to drink alcohol for health reasons. For
adults who do drink alcohol, the Committee's review indicated that, at all
levels of consumption, drinking less is generally better for health than drinking
more. The Committee recommended that adults limit alcohol intake to no more than 1
drink per day for both women and men for better health.</p>
<p>The Committee suggested that, for adults and for children 2 years and older, a
recommendation of less than 6% of energy from added sugars is more consistent with a
dietary pattern that is both nutritionally and calorically appropriate, than is a
pattern with less than 10% of energy from added sugars, as was recommended in past
editions of the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em>. The Committee's advice
was based on food pattern modeling and the evidence on health impacts of added
sugars intake.</p>
<p>Finally, the Committee continued to recommend established USDA Food Patterns: Healthy
U.S.-Style, Healthy Vegetarian Style, and Healthy Mediterranean-Style. The core
components of all 3 USDA Food Patterns include fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole
grains, nuts, and seeds; protein and fats from nutrient-rich food sources; and
limited amounts of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.</p>
<p>The <em>Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory
Committee</em> summarizes a wealth of nutrition research completed by
nutrition investigators throughout the world and served as the scientific basis for
the <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025.</em></p></section><section id="sec9"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT</h2>
<p>The public was encouraged to provide input at various times throughout the process of
the development of the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em>. Before the 2020 Advisory
Committee was established, the public was invited to provide comments on the topics
and scientific questions to be examined by the Committee. The public was also able
to nominate candidates for Committee membership. For the first time in the Committee
process, draft protocols were posted online for public comments to the Committee
before they were finalized. The public was also invited to submit written comments
and to provide oral testimony to the Committee during the time that the Committee
was reviewing the evidence. In addition, after the Committee's scientific
report was submitted to the Departments, the public was able to give written
comments, for a time, as well as oral comments on the report to federal staff at a
public meeting. The Committee received more than 62 000 written public comments from
March 12, 2019, to June 10, 2020, which consisted of approximately 4000 unique
comments.</p>
<section id="sec10"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Development of the Dietary Guidelines</h3>
<p>Each edition of the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> builds on the preceding
edition, with the scientific justification for revisions informed by the
Advisory Committee's <em>Scientific Report</em>, consultation
with subject matter experts within federal agencies, and consideration of
comments from these agencies and the public. The USDA and HHS received 38 000
comments on the Advisory Committee's <em>Scientific Report</em>,
and these were considered in the development of the <em>Dietary
Guidelines.</em></p>
<p>Development of the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> involves a step-by-step
process of writing, review, and revision supported by a writing team of federal
staff from USDA and HHS. The writing team included federal nutrition scientists
with expertise in the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> and related research
and programs as well as specialists with expertise in communicating nutrition
information. It was written with the fundamental understanding that it must
represent the totality of the evidence, address the needs of federal programs,
work to reduce unintended consequences, follow best practices, and use plain
language. The draft <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> then underwent several
rounds of review and revisions by all agencies with nutrition policies and
programs across the USDA and HHS, as well as external experts. The review
finally culminated with the Secretaries of USDA and HHS. After approval by the
Secretaries, the Departments released the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> to
federal agencies and the public for implementation across programs and through
educational activities.</p>
<p>The <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025</em> includes
nearly all of the science-based recommendations of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee, including new dietary advice for infants and toddlers. The
<em>Dietary Guidelines</em> includes part, but not all, of the
Committee's advice on added sugars and alcohol. The new edition
emphasizes the importance of limiting intakes of added sugars and alcoholic
beverages but does not include the changes to quantitative limits recommended by
the Committee. The evidence that the Committee reviewed supports the need to
continue to limit intakes of added sugars and alcoholic beverages to promote
health and prevent diseases. However, there was not a preponderance of evidence
in the Committee's review of studies since the 2015–2020 edition
to substantiate changes to the quantitative limits for either added sugars or
alcohol. The <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> underscores the importance of
limiting added sugars and alcohol intake and carries forward the quantitative
limits from the 2015–2020 edition. The USDA and HHS encourage more
research on the relationship between added sugars and alcoholic beverages and
health and will continue to monitor the evidence on these topics.</p></section></section><section id="sec11"><h2 class="pmc_sec_title">KEY CONCEPTS FROM THE <em>DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS,
2020–2025</em>
</h2>
<p>Chapter 1 of the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> discusses 4 overarching
guidelines (Figure <a href="#F3" class="usa-link">3</a>) that serve to promote
healthy dietary patterns across the life span and are supported by key
recommendations that provide more specific guidance. These core recommendations are
consistent with the <em>2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines</em>.</p>

<div class="p text-right font-secondary"><a href="figure/F3/" class="usa-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open in a new tab</a></div>
<figcaption><p>The four overarching guidelines of the <em>Dietary Guidelines for
Americans, 2020–2025</em>.</p></figcaption></figure><p>The 4 guidelines are as follows:</p>
<ol class="list" style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li>
<p><strong>Follow a healthy dietary pattern at every life stage:</strong> At every
life stage—infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence, adulthood,
pregnancy, lactation, and older adulthood—it is never too early or
too late to eat healthfully.</p>
<p>For approximately the first 6 months of life, exclusively feed infants human
milk. Continue to feed infants human milk through at least the first year of
life, and longer if desired. Feed infants iron-fortified infant formula
during the first year of life when human milk is unavailable. Provide
infants with supplemental vitamin D beginning soon after birth. At
approximately 6 months old, introduce infants to nutrient-dense
complementary foods. Introduce infants to potentially allergenic foods along
with other complementary foods. Encourage infants and toddlers to consume a
variety of foods from all food groups. Include foods rich in iron and zinc,
particularly for infants fed human milk. From 3 months through older
adulthood, follow a healthy dietary pattern across the life span to meet
nutrient needs, help achieve a healthy body weight, and reduce the risk of
chronic disease.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customize and enjoy nutrient-dense food and beverage choices to reflect
personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budgetary
considerations.</strong> A healthy dietary pattern can benefit all
individuals regardless of age, race, ethnicity, or current health status.
The <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> provides a framework intended to be
customized to individual needs and preferences, as well as the foodways of
the diverse cultures in the United States, which can be found at <a href="http://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/DGA_2020-2025_Customizing.pdf" class="usa-link usa-link--external" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.dietaryguidelines.gov/DGA_2020-2025_Customizing.pdf</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Focus on meeting food group needs with nutrient-dense foods and
beverages, and stay within calorie limits.</strong> An underlying premise
of the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> is that nutritional needs should
be met primarily from foods and beverages—specifically,
nutrient-dense foods and beverages. Nutrient-dense foods provide vitamins,
minerals, and other health-promoting components and have no or little added
sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. A healthy dietary pattern consists of
nutrient-dense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups, in
recommended amounts, and within calorie limits.</p>
<p>The core elements that make up a healthy dietary pattern include the following:</p>
<ul class="list" style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><p>Vegetables of all types—dark green; red and orange; beans, peas, and
lentils; starchy; and other vegetables</p></li>
<li><p>Fruits, especially whole fruits</p></li>
<li><p>Grains, at least half of which are whole grain</p></li>
<li><p>Dairy, including fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese, and/or
lactose-free versions and fortified soy beverages and yogurt as
alternatives</p></li>
<li><p>Protein foods, including lean meats, poultry, and eggs; seafood; beans, peas,
and lentils; and nuts, seeds, and soy products</p></li>
<li><p>Oils, including vegetable oils and oils in food, such as seafood and nuts</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limit foods and beverages higher in added sugars, saturated fat, and
sodium, and limit alcoholic beverages.</strong> At every life stage,
meeting food group recommendations—even with nutrient-dense
choices—requires most of a person's daily calorie needs and
sodium limits. A healthy dietary pattern does not have much room for extra
added sugars, saturated fat, or sodium—or for alcoholic beverages. A
small amount of added sugars, saturated fat, or sodium can be added to
nutrient-dense foods and beverages to help meet food group recommendations,
but foods and beverages high in these components should be limited.</p>
<ul class="list" style="list-style-type:none"><li><p>Limits are the following:</p></li></ul>
<ul class="list" style="list-style-type:disc">
<li><p>Added sugars—less than 10% of calories per day starting at the
age of 2 years. Avoid foods and beverages with added sugars for
those younger than 2 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Saturated fat—less than 10% of calories per day starting at
the age of 2 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Sodium—less than 2300 mg per day and even less for children
younger than 14 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Alcoholic beverages—Adults of legal drinking age can choose
not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2
drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for
women, when alcohol is consumed. Drinking less is better for health
than drinking more. There are some adults who should not drink
alcohol, such as women who are pregnant.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the guidelines and key recommendations, there are several dietary
principles provided to help inform decisions about nutrient-dense food and
beverages. These are the following:</p>
<ol class="list" style="list-style-type:decimal">
<li><p>Meet nutritional needs primarily from foods and beverages—a concept
that has always been emphasized in the <em>Dietary
Guidelines</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a variety of options from each food group.</p></li>
<li><p>Pay attention to portion size.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The importance of nutrient-dense choices is a theme embedded within the
<em>Dietary Guidelines</em>, with several graphic examples that help
explain how single food and beverage choices can help people adopt healthy dietary
patterns (Figure <a href="#F4" class="usa-link">4</a>).</p>

<p>Guidance and special considerations for each life stage are discussed in Chapters 2
to 6. This is the first edition of the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> to
provide specific recommendations for each life stage. Chapter 2 provides specific
key recommendations for infants and toddlers (birth through 23 months old), along
with guidance on how to put these recommendations into action. Chapters 3 to 6
(Children – Older Adults) describe nutrition issues specific to each age
group, present the recommended Healthy Dietary Patterns, explain how current intakes
compare with recommendations, discuss special dietary guidance considerations, and
conclude with ways to support healthy dietary patterns across each life stage. More
detailed information about nutrition guidance for each life stage can be found in
the full policy document at <a href="http://dietaryguidelines.gov" class="usa-link usa-link--external" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietaryguidelines.gov</a>.</p>
<section id="sec13"><h3 class="pmc_sec_title">Implementation</h3>
<p>The US Government uses the <em>Dietary Guidelines</em> as the basis of
its food assistance and meal programs, nutrition education efforts, and
decisions about national health objectives. The <em>Dietary
Guidelines</em> also provides a critical structure for state and local
public health promotion and disease prevention initiatives. In addition, it
provides foundational, evidence-based nutrition guidance for use by individuals
and those who serve them in public and private settings, including health
professionals, public health and social service agencies, healthcare and
educational institutions, researchers, agricultural producers, food and beverage
manufacturers, and more.</p>
<p>The <em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em> is developed for the
American public but is written for a professional audience. Therefore, its
translation into actionable consumer messages and resources is crucial to help
individuals, families, and communities achieve healthy dietary patterns.</p>
<p>One implementation method is through USDA's MyPlate, which is a resource
used by both federal and nonfederal professionals and programs to help Americans
build healthy eating patterns by making healthy choices across the food groups
(Figure <a href="#F5" class="usa-link">5</a>). The Department of
Agriculture's campaign “Start Simple with MyPlate” offers
resources to help Americans put the <em>Guidelines</em> into practice
starting today. This campaign provides inspiration and simple ideas that people
can incorporate into their busy lives to help them improve their health and
well-being over time. Key MyPlate tools and resources include the newly designed
website <a href="http://MyPlate.gov" class="usa-link usa-link--external" data-ga-action="click_feat_suppl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyPlate.gov</a>, the new MyPlate Quiz to get personalized resources,
Start Simple with MyPlate app that allows users to set goals, personalized
MyPlate plans for personal food group targets, and a new toolkit for partners
and professionals.</p>
