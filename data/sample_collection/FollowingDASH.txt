Calorie Needs
To figure out your calorie needs, you need to consider your age and physical activity level. If you want to maintain your current weight, you should eat only as many calories as you burn by being physically active. This is called energy balance. (For more information about energy balance, go to the Health Topics Overweight and Obesity article.)
If you need to lose weight, you should eat fewer calories than you burn or increase your activity level to burn more calories than you eat.
Consider your physical activity level. Are you sedentary, moderately active, or active?
		Sedentary means that you do only light physical activity as part of your typical daily routine.
		Moderately active means that you do physical activity equal to walking about 1.5 to 3 miles a day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, plus light physical activity.
		Active means that you do physical activity equal to walking more than 3 miles per day at 3 to 4 miles per hour, plus light physical activity.
Use the chart below to estimate your daily calorie needs.
