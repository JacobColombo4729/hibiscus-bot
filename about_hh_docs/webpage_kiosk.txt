Bring Preventive Health Screenings

On-Site with the Hibiscus Health Kiosk
What is the Hibiscus Health kiosk?
The Hibiscus Health Kiosk is a smart, self–service wellness station that brings biometric screenings directly to your workplace, with no medical staff, waiting rooms, or disruptions.
In just 30 seconds, employees can complete a private, AI-powered face scan to receive personalized health insights, all from a secure, easy-to-use kiosk. It’s a modern solution for preventive care that’s fast, cost-effective, and designed for today’s on-site and hybrid workforces.

Why It’s a Fit for Your Workforce
“The kiosk completely blew my mind. I understood the smartphone capability, but the kiosk takes this to another level. It’s ideal for our manufacturing clients who have large warehouses or near-site clinics. Positioning it near clinic entrances could significantly boost preventive screenings and engagement due to its convenience and real-time results."
